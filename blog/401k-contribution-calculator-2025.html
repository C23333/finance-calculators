                    <h2>Traditional vs Roth 401(k)</h2>
                    <p>Many employers now offer both options. Here's how to choose:</p>

                    <h3>Choose Traditional 401(k) If:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You're in a high tax bracket now (24%+)</li>
                        <li>You expect lower income in retirement</li>
                        <li>You want to reduce current taxable income</li>
                        <li>You're close to retirement</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Choose Roth 401(k) If:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You're in a lower tax bracket now (12-22%)</li>
                        <li>You expect higher income in retirement</li>
                        <li>You want tax-free withdrawals in retirement</li>
                        <li>You're young with decades of growth ahead</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h4>Pro Tip: Split Your Contributions</h4>
                        <p>Consider splitting between Traditional and Roth 401(k) for tax diversification. This gives you flexibility in retirement to manage your tax bracket.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>How to Increase Your Contribution</h2>
                    <p>If you can't hit 15% right away, use these strategies:</p>

                    <h3>1. Start with the Match</h3>
                    <p>Begin by contributing enough to get your full employer match. This is an immediate 50-100% return on your money.</p>

                    <h3>2. Increase by 1% Each Year</h3>
                    <p>Bump your contribution by 1% annually. You'll barely notice the difference in your paycheck, but it adds up significantly over time.</p>

                    <h3>3. Save Your Raises</h3>
                    <p>When you get a raise, increase your 401(k) contribution by half the raise amount. You still get more take-home pay, but you're also saving more.</p>

                    <h3>4. Use Windfalls</h3>
                    <p>Tax refunds, bonuses, and gifts can boost your retirement savings. Consider increasing your contribution rate temporarily.</p>

                    <h2>What If You Can't Afford 15%?</h2>
                    <p>Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Any amount helps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>3%:</strong> Better than nothing, gets some employer match</li>
                        <li><strong>6%:</strong> Usually captures full employer match</li>
                        <li><strong>10%:</strong> Solid foundation for retirement</li>
                        <li><strong>15%:</strong> On track for comfortable retirement</li>
                        <li><strong>20%+:</strong> Early retirement possible</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Power of Starting Early</h2>
                    <p>Time is your greatest asset. Here's how $500/month grows at 7% average return:</p>
