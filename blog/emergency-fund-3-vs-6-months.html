                    <p class="article-intro">The classic advice is to save 3-6 months of expenses. But which number is right for you? Let's figure out your ideal emergency fund size.</p>

                <div class="article-content">
                    <h2>The Quick Answer</h2>
                    <p>Most people should aim for <strong>3-6 months of essential expenses</strong>. The exact amount depends on your job stability, income sources, and personal circumstances.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Rule of Thumb</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>3 months:</strong> Stable job, dual income, low expenses</li>
                            <li><strong>6 months:</strong> Single income, variable income, or specialized career</li>
                            <li><strong>9-12 months:</strong> Self-employed, commission-based, or high-risk industry</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>What Counts as "Expenses"?</h2>
                    <p>Your emergency fund should cover <strong>essential expenses only</strong> - what you'd need to survive if you lost your income:</p>

                    <h3>Include These:</h3>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Food (groceries, not dining out)</li>
                        <li>Transportation (car payment, insurance, gas)</li>
                        <li>Health insurance</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dual income household</strong> - Partner can cover expenses temporarily</li>
                        <li><strong>Very stable job</strong> - Government, tenured, union position</li>
                        <li><strong>High-demand skills</strong> - Could find new job quickly</li>

                        <li><strong>Single income</strong> - No backup if you lose your job</li>

                        <li><strong>Specialized career</strong> - Fewer job opportunities, longer search</li>
                        <li><strong>Health concerns</strong> - Chronic illness, disability risk</li>
                        <li><strong>Homeowner</strong> - Unexpected repairs can be expensive</li>

                        <li><strong>Volatile industry</strong> - Tech layoffs, retail closures</li>

                    <h2>When You Need 9-12 Months</h2>

                        <li><strong>Self-employed or freelancer</strong> - Income can disappear quickly</li>

                        <li><strong>Niche expertise</strong> - Very few job openings in your field</li>
                        <li><strong>Planning major life change</strong> - Career switch, starting business</li>
                        <li><strong>High anxiety about money</strong> - Peace of mind has value</li>

                    <h2>Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund</h2>
                    <p>Your emergency fund should be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Liquid</strong> - Accessible within 1-2 days</li>

                    <h2>How to Build Your Emergency Fund</h2>

                    <h3>Step 1: Start with $1,000</h3>
                    <p>Before tackling the full 3-6 months, build a starter fund of $1,000. This prevents small emergencies from becoming debt.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Automate Your Savings</h3>
                    <p>Set up automatic transfers on payday. Even $100/week adds up to $5,200/year.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Use Windfalls</h3>
                    <p>Tax refunds, bonuses, and gifts can accelerate your progress. Commit to saving at least 50% of any windfall.</p>

                    <h3>Step 4: Cut One Expense</h3>
                    <p>Cancel one subscription or reduce one expense. Redirect that money to your emergency fund.</p>

                    <h3>Step 5: Increase Income Temporarily</h3>
                    <p>Side gigs, overtime, or selling unused items can boost your savings rate.</p>
