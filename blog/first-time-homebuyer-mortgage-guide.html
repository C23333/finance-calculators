                    <h2>Step 5: Shop for the Best Rate</h2>
                    <p>Even a 0.25% difference in interest rate can save thousands over the life of your loan.</p>

                    <h3>Rate Shopping Tips:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Get at least 3 quotes</strong> from different lenders</li>
                        <li><strong>Compare on the same day</strong> - rates change daily</li>
                        <li><strong>Look at APR, not just rate</strong> - APR includes fees</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask about points</strong> - paying points can lower your rate</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple inquiries within 45 days</strong> count as one credit check</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Rate Lock</h4>
                        <p>Once you find a good rate, lock it in. Rate locks typically last 30-60 days. If rates drop significantly, ask about a "float down" option.</p>
