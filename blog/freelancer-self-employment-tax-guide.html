                    <p>Self-employment tax is the Social Security and Medicare tax that self-employed people pay. When you're an employee, your employer pays half of these taxes. As a freelancer, you pay both halves.</p>

                    <p>To avoid penalties, pay at least:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>100% of last year's tax</strong> (110% if income over $150,000), OR</li>
                        <li><strong>90% of this year's tax</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>A simple approach: Set aside 25-30% of every payment you receive for taxes.</p>

                    <h2>Tax Deductions for Freelancers</h2>
                    <p>Reduce your taxable income with these common deductions:</p>

                    <h3>Home Office Deduction</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Simplified method:</strong> $5 per square foot, up to 300 sq ft ($1,500 max)</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular method:</strong> Actual expenses Ã— percentage of home used for business</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Business Expenses</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Computer and equipment</li>
                        <li>Software and subscriptions</li>
                        <li>Office supplies</li>
                        <li>Professional development and courses</li>
                        <li>Business travel</li>
                        <li>Marketing and advertising</li>
                        <li>Professional services (accountant, lawyer)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Health Insurance Deduction</h3>
                    <p>Self-employed individuals can deduct 100% of health insurance premiums for themselves and their family. This is an "above the line" deduction, meaning you get it even if you don't itemize.</p>

                    <h3>Retirement Contributions</h3>
                    <ul>
