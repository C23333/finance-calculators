                        <h2>Current Mortgage Rates: January 18, 2026</h2>
<p>Here's where mortgage rates stand as of January 18, 2026:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Loan Type</th><th>Current Rate</th><th>Weekly Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>30-Year Fixed</td><td>6.62%</td><td>-0.19%</td></tr><tr><td>15-Year Fixed</td><td>5.89%</td><td>-0.15%</td></tr><tr><td>30-Year FHA</td><td>6.25%</td><td>-0.17%</td></tr><tr><td>30-Year VA</td><td>6.18%</td><td>-0.16%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These rates represent national averages. Your actual rate depends on your credit score, down payment, loan amount, and the lender you choose.</p>
<h2>Why Did Rates Drop This Week?</h2>
<p>Several factors contributed to this week's rate decline:</p><ul><li><strong>Treasury yield movement:</strong> The 10-year Treasury yield, which heavily influences mortgage rates, retreated from recent highs as investors reassessed inflation expectations.</li><li><strong>Economic data:</strong> Recent reports suggesting a cooling labor market gave the Federal Reserve room to maintain its current policy stance.</li><li><strong>Market expectations:</strong> Investors are pricing in the possibility of Fed rate cuts later in 2026 if inflation continues its gradual decline.</li></ul><p>While a 19-basis-point drop may seem modest, on a $400,000 mortgage it translates to approximately $45 in monthly savings—or over $16,000 across a 30-year loan.</p>
<h2>Should You Lock Your Rate Now?</h2>
<p>The million-dollar question: Are rates heading lower, or is this a good time to lock?</p><p>Rate timing is notoriously difficult to predict. Consider these factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Your timeline:</strong> If you're closing within 30-60 days, locking now protects you from potential increases.</li><li><strong>Rate lock costs:</strong> Longer lock periods typically cost more. A 60-day lock might add 0.125% to your rate compared to a 30-day lock.</li><li><strong>Float-down options:</strong> Some lenders offer float-down provisions that let you benefit if rates drop further after you lock.</li></ul><p>If current rates allow you to comfortably afford your target home, locking makes sense. Trying to time the absolute bottom often leads to missed opportunities.</p>

            <h3>Calculate Your Mortgage Payment</h3>
            <p>Calculate your exact monthly payment with today&#039;s rates, including taxes and insurance</p>
            <a href="/calculators/mortgage.html" class="cta-btn">Mortgage Payment Calculator -></a>
        </div>
    <h2>How This Affects Your Buying Power</h2>
<p>Lower rates directly expand what you can afford. Here's how the 19-basis-point drop affects monthly payments on different loan amounts:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Loan Amount</th><th>Payment at 6.81%</th><th>Payment at 6.62%</th><th>Monthly Savings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>$300,000</td><td>$1,958</td><td>$1,924</td><td>$34</td></tr><tr><td>$400,000</td><td>$2,611</td><td>$2,565</td><td>$46</td></tr><tr><td>$500,000</td><td>$3,264</td><td>$3,206</td><td>$58</td></tr><tr><td>$600,000</td><td>$3,917</td><td>$3,847</td><td>$70</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These savings compound over time. On a $500,000 loan, you'd save nearly $21,000 in interest over 30 years with the lower rate.</p>
<h2>Is Refinancing Worth It Now?</h2>
<p>If you purchased your home when rates peaked above 7%, this week's drop might make refinancing attractive. The general rule: refinancing makes sense when you can lower your rate by at least 0.5% to 0.75%.</p><p>Before refinancing, calculate your break-even point. If closing costs total $6,000 and you save $150 monthly, you'll recoup those costs in 40 months. Plan to stay in your home longer than that? Refinancing likely pays off.</p><p>Don't forget to factor in:</p><ul><li>Current home equity (most lenders require 20% for the best rates)</li><li>Your credit score (has it improved since your original loan?)</li><li>Remaining loan term (refinancing to a new 30-year loan restarts your <a href="/calculators/mortgage.html" title="Use our amortization tool" class="internal-link">amortization</a> clock)</li></ul>

        </div>
    <h2>What to Expect in the Weeks Ahead</h2>
<p>While no one can predict rates with certainty, several upcoming events could influence mortgage rate direction:</p><ul><li><strong>January 29:</strong> Federal Reserve meeting and policy statement</li><li><strong>February 7:</strong> January jobs report</li><li><strong>February 12:</strong> Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data</li></ul><p>Strong economic data or stubborn inflation could push rates back up. Conversely, signs of economic cooling might accelerate the downward trend.</p><p>Most forecasters expect rates to remain in the 6% to 7% range through the first half of 2026, with gradual improvement possible in the second half if inflation continues easing.</p>
