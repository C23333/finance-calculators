                <p class="lead">Teacher retirement planning is uniquely complex, involving pensions, 403(b) plans, and varying Social Security eligibility. This comprehensive guide helps you understand your benefits and calculate your ideal retirement age and income.</p>

                <div class="key-takeaways">
                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teacher pensions typically replace 50-75% of final salary after 25-30 years</li>
                        <li>403(b) contributions up to $23,500 in 2026 ($31,000 if 50+)</li>
                        <li>15 states don't participate in Social Security for teachers</li>
                        <li>Rule of 80/90 determines full retirement eligibility in many states</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Understanding Teacher Retirement Benefits</h2>
                <p>Teachers typically have access to three potential retirement income sources:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Defined Benefit Pension</strong> - Guaranteed monthly income based on salary and years of service</li>
                    <li><strong>403(b) or 457(b) Plans</strong> - Tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Security</strong> - Available in some states, reduced or unavailable in others</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>How Teacher Pensions Work</h2>
                <p>Most teacher pensions use a formula to calculate your benefit:</p>

                <div class="formula-box">
                    <h4>Pension Formula</h4>
                    <p><strong>Annual Pension = Final Average Salary × Years of Service × Multiplier</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Understanding Each Component</h3>

                <h4>Final Average Salary (FAS)</h4>
                <p>Usually the average of your highest 3-5 consecutive years of earnings. Some states use your final year's salary.</p>

                <h4>Years of Service</h4>
                <p>Total years worked in the pension system. Some states allow service credit purchases for additional years.</p>

                <h4>Multiplier</h4>
                <p>The percentage applied per year of service, typically ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%.</p>

                <p>Retirement eligibility varies by state, but common rules include:</p>

                <h3>Rule of 80 or Rule of 90</h3>
                <p>Your age plus years of service must equal 80 or 90 for full benefits.</p>

                <p>Here's how to estimate your complete retirement picture:</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Example: 30-Year Teacher in Texas</h4>
                    <p><strong>Current salary:</strong> $70,000</p>
                    <p><strong>Final average salary:</strong> $75,000 (projected)</p>
                    <p><strong>Years of service:</strong> 30</p>
                    <p><strong>TRS multiplier:</strong> 2.3%</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>TRS Pension:</strong> $75,000 × 30 × 2.3% = $51,750/year ($4,313/month)</li>

                <h2>Strategies to Maximize Teacher Retirement</h2>

                <h3>1. Maximize Your Final Average Salary</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take on extra duties (coaching, department head) in final years</li>
                    <li>Pursue advanced degrees for salary bumps</li>
                    <li>Understand how your state calculates FAS</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Consider Service Credit Purchases</h3>
                <p>Many states allow you to purchase additional service credit for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Military service</li>
                    <li>Out-of-state teaching</li>
                    <li>Maternity/paternity leave</li>
                    <li>Unpaid leave periods</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Optimize 403(b) Investments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid high-fee annuity products (common in 403(b) plans)</li>
                    <li>Choose low-cost index funds when available</li>
                    <li>Consider target-date funds for simplicity</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Plan for Healthcare</h3>
                <p>Many teacher retirement systems offer retiree health insurance, but coverage and costs vary significantly. Factor this into your retirement budget.</p>

                <h2>Common Teacher Retirement Mistakes</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Leaving too early:</strong> Each additional year can significantly increase your pension</li>
                    <li><strong>Ignoring 403(b):</strong> Relying solely on pension may not provide enough income</li>
                    <li><strong>High-fee 403(b) products:</strong> Some annuities charge 2-3% annually</li>
                    <li><strong>Not understanding WEP:</strong> Can reduce expected Social Security by thousands</li>
                    <li><strong>Forgetting about inflation:</strong> Many pensions have limited or no COLA adjustments</li>
                </ol>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>When can teachers retire with full benefits?</h3>
                        <p>Most teacher pension systems allow full retirement benefits when you reach the "Rule of 80" or "Rule of 90" (age + years of service = 80 or 90), or at a specific age like 60-65 with minimum years of service (typically 5-10 years). Some states offer early retirement at 55 with reduced benefits.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much pension will I get as a teacher?</h3>
                        <p>Teacher pensions typically use a formula: Final Average Salary × Years of Service × Multiplier (usually 1.5-2.5%). For example, a teacher with 30 years of service, $70,000 final salary, and 2% multiplier would receive: $70,000 × 30 × 0.02 = $42,000 per year ($3,500/month).</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do teachers get Social Security?</h3>
                        <p>It depends on your state. Teachers in about 15 states (including California, Texas, Ohio, Illinois) do NOT participate in Social Security and rely solely on their pension. Teachers in other states receive both pension and Social Security benefits, though the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) may reduce Social Security benefits.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Should teachers invest in a 403(b)?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, a 403(b) is highly recommended for teachers. It provides tax-advantaged savings to supplement your pension, especially important since pensions may not fully replace your income. In 2026, you can contribute up to $23,500 ($31,000 if 50+). Many districts offer matching contributions.</p>

                        <h3>How do I calculate my teacher retirement income?</h3>
                        <p>Calculate total retirement income by adding: 1) Pension benefit (salary × years × multiplier), 2) 403(b)/457(b) withdrawals (balance ÷ years in retirement), 3) Social Security (if eligible), and 4) Any other savings. Aim for 70-80% of pre-retirement income for comfortable retirement.</p>
