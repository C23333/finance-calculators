    "intro": "<p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure crept higher in November, reaching 2.8% and drifting further from the central bank's 2% target. While this reading matched economists' expectations, it signals that the battle against inflation isn't over yet.</p><p>For everyday Americans, this means continued pressure on household budgets and potentially higher borrowing costs for longer. Whether you're planning to buy a home, refinance your mortgage, or simply trying to make your paycheck stretch further, understanding these inflation numbers matters more than ever.</p>",

        "heading": "What the November PCE Data Shows",
        "content": "<p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index—the Federal Reserve's go-to inflation metric—rose 2.8% year-over-year in November 2026. This represents a slight uptick from October's reading and moves inflation further from the Fed's stated 2% goal.</p><p>Core PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also remained elevated. This stubborn persistence in underlying inflation suggests that price pressures remain embedded in the economy, particularly in services sectors like housing, healthcare, and insurance.</p><p>Why does the Fed prefer PCE over the more widely reported Consumer Price Index (CPI)? The PCE captures a broader range of consumer spending and adjusts more quickly when consumers switch between products due to price changes—giving policymakers a more accurate picture of real-world inflation.</p>"

        "heading": "Why Inflation Remains Sticky",
        "content": "<p>Several factors continue to keep inflation above the Fed's target:</p><ul><li><strong>Housing costs:</strong> Shelter inflation remains elevated as rental prices and homeownership costs stay high</li><li><strong>Services sector:</strong> Prices for healthcare, insurance, and personal services continue rising faster than goods</li><li><strong>Wage growth:</strong> While moderating, wage increases still put upward pressure on service-sector prices</li><li><strong>Supply chain normalization:</strong> Though improved from pandemic peaks, some supply constraints persist</li></ul><p>The good news? Goods inflation has largely normalized, and energy prices have stabilized. The challenge lies in bringing down services inflation without triggering a recession—the Fed's delicate balancing act.</p>"

For borrowers, this translates to:</p><ul><li><strong>Mortgage rates:</strong> Likely to remain elevated, hovering in the mid-to-high 6% range for 30-year fixed loans</li><li><strong>Credit cards:</strong> APRs will stay high, making it crucial to pay down balances</li><li><strong>Auto loans:</strong> Financing costs remain elevated for new vehicle purchases</li><li><strong>Savings accounts:</strong> The silver lining—high-yield savings accounts continue offering attractive returns</li></ul>"

When inflation runs hot, the Fed keeps rates higher to cool the economy—and mortgage rates tend to follow.</p><p>Consider this: On a $400,000 mortgage, the difference between a 6% and 7% interest rate amounts to roughly $260 more per month—over $93,000 extra in interest over a 30-year loan. That's real money that could go toward retirement savings, your children's education, or building emergency funds.</p><p>Use our calculator below to see exactly how current rates affect your potential mortgage payment.</p>"

    "keyTakeaways": [
      "PCE inflation reached 2.8% in November 2026, moving further from the Fed's 2% target",
      "The Fed may delay additional rate cuts, keeping mortgage rates elevated into 2026",
      "Services inflation remains the primary driver, with housing costs staying high",

    "conclusion": "<p>November's inflation reading reminds us that the path back to price stability takes time. While 2.8% PCE inflation won't dramatically change your day-to-day life overnight, it shapes the broader economic environment—influencing everything from mortgage rates to savings returns.</p><p>The smart move? Stay informed, run the numbers on your personal situation, and make financial decisions based on today's reality rather than hoping for rate cuts that may take longer to materialize. Use our mortgage calculator to understand exactly what current rates mean for your home buying plans.</p>"

      {
        "question": "What is PCE inflation and why does the Fed use it?",
        "answer": "PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) inflation is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of price changes in the economy. The Fed prefers it over CPI because PCE captures a broader range of spending, accounts for changes in consumer behavior, and provides a more comprehensive view of inflation across the economy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does 2.8% inflation affect mortgage rates?",
        "answer": "When inflation runs above the Fed's 2% target, the central bank tends to keep interest rates higher to cool the economy. This results in elevated mortgage rates, as lenders price in the higher rate environment. Currently, this means 30-year fixed mortgage rates remain in the mid-to-high 6% range."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the Fed cut interest rates in 2026?",
        "answer": "With PCE inflation at 2.8%—above the Fed's 2% target—the central bank may delay additional rate cuts. Market expectations suggest the Fed will proceed cautiously, potentially holding rates steady until clearer progress toward the inflation target emerges."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is core PCE inflation?",
        "answer": "Core PCE excludes volatile food and energy prices to show underlying inflation trends. This measure helps the Fed understand persistent price pressures in the economy without the noise from fluctuating gas and grocery prices."
