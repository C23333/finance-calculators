      "loanDepot offers conventional, FHA, VA, and jumbo loans nationwide with online, phone, and in-person application options",

      "No USDA loans or home equity products are available—look elsewhere if you need these options",
      "Customer experience varies; request direct contact info for your loan officer and stay proactive about communication",
      "Always comparison shop with at least three lenders to ensure you're getting competitive rates and fees"

    "conclusion": "<p>loanDepot occupies a middle ground in the mortgage market—more technologically advanced than traditional banks but offering more personal service options than purely digital lenders. Their Lifetime Guarantee provides genuine value for borrowers who anticipate refinancing multiple times.</p><p>However, the lack of upfront rate transparency and absence of USDA and home equity products limit their appeal for some borrowers. As with any major financial decision, get quotes from multiple lenders and compare total loan costs—not just interest rates—before committing.</p><p>Ready to see how a loanDepot mortgage payment would fit your budget?
