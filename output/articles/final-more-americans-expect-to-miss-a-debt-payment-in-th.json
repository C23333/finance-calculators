    "intro": "<p>More Americans are bracing for the possibility of missing a debt payment in the coming months, and the consequences could be severe. According to a new LendingTree report, a single missed payment can slash your credit score by approximately 80 points—a financial setback that takes years to fully recover from.</p><p>If you're worried about keeping up with bills, understanding exactly how missed payments damage your credit can help you prioritize and protect your financial health. Here's what you need to know.</p>",

        "heading": "Why Payment History Matters Most",
        "content": "<p>Your payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score—the single largest factor in credit scoring. This means that even one late payment carries more weight than your credit utilization, length of credit history, or mix of credit types combined.</p><p>Credit bureaus track your payment behavior in 30-day increments. A payment becomes \"late\" for credit reporting purposes once it's 30 days past due. The longer it remains unpaid, the more damage it inflicts:</p><ul><li><strong>30 days late:</strong> Initial negative mark appears on your report</li><li><strong>60 days late:</strong> More severe impact; additional penalty</li><li><strong>90+ days late:</strong> Significant damage; may be sent to collections</li><li><strong>Charge-off (180+ days):</strong> Creditor writes off the debt; major credit damage</li></ul>"

        "content": "<p>The 80-point average drop cited in LendingTree's research represents a middle estimate. Your actual impact depends on where you start:</p><p><strong>Higher credit scores fall harder.</strong> If you have a 780 credit score with a clean payment history, a single missed payment can drop you by 100 points or more. Someone with a 650 score and existing blemishes might see a smaller decline of 60-70 points.</p><p>This asymmetry exists because credit scoring models view a missed payment from someone with excellent credit as a significant departure from their established pattern—a red flag that carries extra weight.</p>"

      "Payment history is the largest factor in your credit score at 35% of your FICO score",
      "Late payments stay on your credit report for seven years but impact diminishes over time",

      "Recovery is possible with consistent on-time payments and responsible credit use"

    "conclusion": "<p>The rising number of Americans expecting to miss debt payments reflects ongoing financial pressures. But forewarned is forearmed. By understanding the severe impact a missed payment has on your credit score—and the years it takes to recover—you can make informed decisions about which financial obligations to prioritize.</p><p>If you're struggling, reach out to creditors before you fall behind. A temporary hardship arrangement is far better than a seven-year blemish on your credit report. And if you've already missed a payment, start rebuilding immediately. Your future self will thank you.</p>"

        "question": "How many points does your credit score drop for a missed payment?",
        "answer": "A single missed payment can drop your credit score by approximately 80 points on average, according to LendingTree research. However, the impact varies based on your starting score—people with higher scores (750+) may see drops of 100 points or more, while those with lower scores may experience smaller declines."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does a late payment stay on your credit report?",
        "answer": "A late payment stays on your credit report for seven years from the original delinquency date. The impact is most severe in the first two years and gradually diminishes over time, assuming you maintain good payment behavior afterward."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I remove a late payment from my credit report?",
        "answer": "You cannot remove an accurate late payment from your credit report before the seven-year period ends. However, you can dispute the entry if the information is incorrect. Some creditors may offer a 'goodwill adjustment' and remove a late payment if you have an otherwise excellent payment history, but this is not guaranteed."
      },
      {
        "question": "When does a late payment get reported to credit bureaus?",
        "answer": "A payment is typically reported as late once it becomes 30 days past due. Payments that are less than 30 days late generally won't appear on your credit report, though you may still incur late fees from your creditor."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if I can't make a payment on time?",
        "answer": "Contact your creditor immediately—before the 30-day mark. Many lenders offer hardship programs, payment deferrals, or modified plans. They often prefer to work with you rather than report a delinquency. You can also look into nonprofit credit counseling services for help creating a debt management plan."
