    "intro": "<p>If you've been waiting months for your student loan forgiveness application or income-driven repayment plan to be processed, you're far from alone. More than 800,000 federal student loan borrowers currently find themselves stuck in a massive backlog, watching interest accrue while their paperwork sits in limbo.</p><p>This processing delay affects borrowers seeking both debt forgiveness and enrollment in affordable repayment plans—leaving many wondering when they'll finally see relief. Here's what's driving this backlog and what options you have while waiting.</p>",

According to recent reports, over 800,000 applications for income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs remain unprocessed. This backlog has left borrowers in a frustrating state of uncertainty—many have submitted complete applications yet received no confirmation of their status for months.</p><p>The backlog affects two primary groups: borrowers applying for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans like the SAVE plan, and those seeking forgiveness through programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or IDR forgiveness after 20-25 years of payments.</p>"

You may be stuck making payments based on outdated income information or enrolled in a less favorable repayment plan than you qualify for.</p><p>For borrowers seeking forgiveness, every month of delay extends your timeline to debt freedom. If you're on track for PSLF or IDR forgiveness, these processing delays can feel particularly frustrating when you've already put in years of qualifying payments.</p>"
