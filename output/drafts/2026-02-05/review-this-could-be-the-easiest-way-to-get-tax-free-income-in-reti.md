## Issues Found

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Unsourced 2024 contribution limits and income thresholds**: The draft cites specific numbers ($7,000/$8,000 IRA limits, $23,000/$30,500 401(k) limits, income phase-out ranges) as "2024" figures, but the source article is from February 2026. These numbers need verification or should reference 2025/2026 limits with proper sourcing. **Fix**: Remove specific year references or update to current year with verified figures and source markers.

2. **RMD age claim unsourced**: The draft states RMDs begin "at age 73 (under current law)" but this is not supported by the provided summary. **Fix**: Remove or add source verification.

3. **Fabricated example numbers**: The $200,000 to $800,000 growth example is not from the source material. **Fix**: Remove specific dollar amounts or clearly label as hypothetical illustration.

4. **Title too long**: "How to Get Tax-Free Income in Retirement: A Guide to Roth Accounts" is 64 characters, exceeding the 50-60 character guideline. **Fix**: Shorten title.

5. **Primary keyword missing from first 100 words**: "Tax-free income in retirement" doesn't appear until well after the first 100 words. **Fix**: Incorporate keyword earlier.

### Moderate Issues (Should Fix)

1. **Meta description at 148 characters**: Slightly under the 150-160 target. Could be strengthened.

2. **No source markers on any claims**: The article lacks `[SOURCE: ...]` markers on factual claims as required by the checklist.

3. **Backdoor Roth strategy details unsourced**: The summary doesn't mention backdoor Roth strategies. This may be general knowledge but should be flagged.

4. **Five-year rule specifics**: The detailed explanation of five-year rules (separate clocks for 401(k) plans, January 1 start date) is not in the provided summary.

### Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)

1. **Some paragraphs exceed 4 sentences**: A few sections could be broken up further.

2. **"The Motley Fool notes" reference**: Should use consistent source citation format.

3. **Calculator placeholders**: Ensure these link to actual calculators on the site.

Building tax-free income in retirement is one of the most effective strategies for managing your tax liability after you stop working. Taxes don't disappear when you retire—Social Security benefits, pension payments, and withdrawals from traditional retirement accounts can all create taxable income, potentially pushing you into higher tax brackets than anticipated.

Roth accounts offer a straightforward solution. While the strategy requires advance planning, the concept itself isn't complicated [SOURCE: The Motley Fool article on tax-free retirement income strategies, published 2026-02-04]. The key is understanding how these accounts work and positioning yourself to take advantage of them before you retire.

## What Makes Roth Accounts Different

The fundamental difference between Roth accounts and traditional retirement accounts comes down to when you pay taxes.

With a traditional IRA or 401(k), you contribute pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income in the year you make the contribution. The trade-off is that you'll pay ordinary income tax on every dollar you withdraw in retirement.

Roth accounts flip this arrangement. You contribute money that's already been taxed—meaning no upfront tax deduction. In exchange, qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free, including both your original contributions and all investment growth.

## Tax-Free Income in Retirement: Your Two Main Options

Two main vehicles exist for building tax-free retirement income: the Roth IRA and the Roth 401(k). While they share the same tax treatment for withdrawals, they differ in important ways.

### Roth IRA

A Roth IRA is an individual account you open and manage yourself, separate from any employer. You choose the brokerage, select your investments, and control the account entirely.

This flexibility is appealing, but Roth IRAs come with income limits. If your modified adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds, your ability to contribute directly phases out or disappears entirely. These limits adjust annually for inflation—check IRS.gov for current year thresholds.

The annual contribution limit for Roth IRAs is also relatively modest compared to workplace plans.

### Roth 401(k)

A Roth 401(k) is offered through an employer's retirement plan. Not all employers offer a Roth option, but availability has increased significantly over the past decade.

The major advantage of a Roth 401(k) is that there are no income limits—high earners who can't contribute to a Roth IRA can still use a Roth 401(k) if their employer offers one. Contribution limits are also much higher than Roth IRAs.

One consideration: employer matching contributions, if offered, typically go into a traditional (pre-tax) account even if you're making Roth contributions. Those matched funds will be taxable when withdrawn.

## The Planning-Ahead Requirement

The strategy for building tax-free retirement income requires planning ahead [SOURCE: The Motley Fool article on tax-free retirement income strategies, published 2026-02-04]. This planning requirement exists for several reasons.

### The Five-Year Rule

Roth accounts have holding requirements before earnings can be withdrawn tax-free. If you're opening your first Roth account later in life, you'll need to factor in this waiting period. Starting earlier gives you more flexibility.

### Building Sufficient Balances

Because Roth contributions don't reduce your current taxable income, some people find it harder to prioritize them over traditional contributions. But waiting until late in your career to start building Roth balances means less time for tax-free growth.

### Income Considerations

If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than you are now—perhaps because of pension income, rental properties, or required minimum distributions from large traditional accounts—paying taxes now through Roth contributions may be advantageous.

Conversely, if you're in peak earning years and expect lower income in retirement, traditional contributions might make more sense. This calculation isn't always straightforward, which is why running projections with a [CALCULATOR: Retirement Calculator] can help clarify your situation.

## Roth Conversions: Another Path to Tax-Free Income

Direct contributions aren't the only way to build Roth balances. You can also convert money from traditional IRAs or 401(k)s into Roth accounts. The catch: you'll owe income tax on the converted amount in the year of conversion.

Roth conversions can make sense in specific situations:

**Lower-income years**: If you have a year with unusually low income—perhaps due to a job transition or early retirement before Social Security begins—you might convert traditional funds at a lower tax rate than you'd pay on withdrawals later.

**Managing future RMDs**: Large traditional account balances lead to large required minimum distributions. Converting some funds to Roth accounts reduces future RMDs and the associated tax burden.

**Estate planning**: Roth accounts passed to heirs maintain their tax-free status for withdrawals, though beneficiaries face their own distribution requirements.

The decision to convert involves weighing current tax costs against future tax savings—a calculation that depends on assumptions about future tax rates, investment returns, and your timeline.

## Tax Diversification: Why It Matters

Rather than choosing exclusively between Roth and traditional accounts, many financial planners recommend building both types of balances. This "tax diversification" provides flexibility in retirement.

With money in both traditional and Roth accounts, you can strategically choose which accounts to draw from each year based on your tax situation. Need to stay under a certain income threshold to qualify for healthcare subsidies or avoid Medicare premium surcharges? Draw from Roth accounts. Have room in a lower tax bracket? Take traditional withdrawals up to that threshold, then switch to Roth.

This flexibility is valuable precisely because future tax rates are uncertain.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Several missteps can undermine a tax-free retirement income strategy:

**Withdrawing too early**: Taking Roth earnings before meeting age and holding requirements can trigger taxes and penalties, eliminating the benefits you were trying to capture.

**Ignoring state taxes**: While Roth withdrawals are federal-tax-free, some states have different rules. Most states follow federal treatment, but verify your state's approach.

**Assuming Roth is always better**: Roth contributions aren't universally superior. If you're in a high tax bracket now and expect to be in a much lower bracket in retirement, traditional contributions might serve you better. The right choice depends on your specific circumstances.

## Key Takeaways

- Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, including on investment gains, making them powerful tools for retirement tax planning.
- Starting early matters because of holding requirements and the value of tax-free compounding over time.
- High earners who can't contribute directly to Roth IRAs may still access Roth 401(k)s through their employers.
- Roth conversions offer another path to tax-free retirement income but require careful analysis of current versus future tax rates.
- Tax diversification—holding both traditional and Roth balances—provides flexibility to manage taxes strategically throughout retirement.

## Conclusion

Building tax-free income in retirement through Roth accounts isn't complicated in concept, but it does require intentional planning [SOURCE: The Motley Fool article on tax-free retirement income strategies, published 2026-02-04]. The earlier you start, the more time your contributions have to grow tax-free and the more flexibility you'll have when you eventually retire.
